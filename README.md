### Description

VBHexic is a hexic clone game I never quite completed. It includes a particle engine and scoring system, along with combinations of all types except for stars. Although it is unfinished, the framework is very sturdy and powerful. Wouldn't take a whole lot to finish this bad boy up. :) Update July 9: Added support for stars, point multipliers, better effects, and some other goodies. Still a pretty dead project, though... I was just bored one night and decided to give it a little work. ;)
